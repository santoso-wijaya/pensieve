# `_includes`

This magic Jekyll folder is generally used by the `include` tag. The include tag
allows you to include the content from another file stored in the `_includes`
folder:

```liquid
{% include footer.html %}
```

Most of the time, we will be using a theme plugin's default files, as they may
have their own `_includes` folder bundled in their gem. We can override any
of them by adding a file here with an identical name.

## `responsive-image.html`

This file is a template that gets used by
[`jekyll-responsive-image`](https://github.com/wildlyinaccurate/jekyll-responsive-image)
plugin. In `_config.yml` you should see:

```yaml
# jekyll-responsive-image configs
responsive_image:
  template: _includes/responsive-image.html
# ...
```

Anytime a Liquid template contains `{% responsive_image ... %}` or
`{% responsive_image_block %} ... {% endresponsive_image_block %}` the plugin's
image processor will generate resized copies of said image (depending on config
options).

Then, in the compiled HTML file in `_site/`, that same tag will be translated
to the content of this `responsive-image.html` template. This template will
be provided an array of resized images by the plugin as template variables.
These variables are documented
[here](https://github.com/wildlyinaccurate/jekyll-responsive-image?tab=readme-ov-file#template-variables).

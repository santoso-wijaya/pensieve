I have been using vim and various IDEs with vim-like bindings for a good long
while now, ever since college.

Lately, I have been curious to try NeoVim and its more powerful features. I am
hoping to power up my homekey usage.

# Installing NeoVim

On Mac OS, with Homebrew, that's trivial.

```sh
$ brew install neovim
```

My muscle memory compels me to type `vim` and `view` when opening text files.
To give NeoVim a fair shake at making it into my core personal toolkit, I
created aliases.

In my `~/.zshrc` file:

```sh
if which nvim >/dev/null; then
  function use-nvim  {
    alias vim="nvim"
    alias vi="nvim"
    alias view="nvim -R"
  }
  use-nvim
fi
```

## User Config

Vim reads from `~/.vimrc` and its plugin, etc lives in `~/.vim/`, while
NeoVim canonically reads its vimrc file from `~/.config/nvim/init.vim` (or
`.lua`) and `~/.config/nvim/`, respectively.

I want to keep things as compatible between the two, for now. In case I decide
later to return to Vim--or if I find myself in a system without the facilities
for NeoVim--I want most of what I use to customize NeoVim to also apply to Vim.

More to the point: I want my Vim and NeoVim installations to share the same
config file.

```sh
$ mkdir ~/.vim/
$ ln -s ../.vim ~/.config/nvim  # this redirects nvim's config dir to vim's
$ ln -s $HOME/.vimrc ~/.vim/init.vim    # redirects init.vim to ~/.vimrc
```

The vimrc file `~/.vimrc` now becomes our master vimrc file. It should work
for both NeoVim and Vim.

Its content, at the moment (I'm currently in the middle of trying out three
new plugins: `vim-commentary`, `vim-easymotion`, and `vim-sneak`):

" Make sure you use single quotes
" Shorthand notation; fetches https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible
Plug 'tpope/vim-sensible'

# Next: Mastering LSPs

For quick edits and one-offs, Vim is great. It lets me live and stay in the
Terminal without too much context switching. For more extensive coding, though,
I still rely on language features and the bells and whistles delivered by an
IDE like VSCode.

Next up, I want to explore LSP servers and understand how NeoVim, as a client,
interacts with them. My goal is to set one up that lets me work comfortably
in some programming languages of choice, wholly in NeoVim.

I spent this weekend building this personal site of mine.

Welcome to my
[pensieve](https://www.wizardingworld.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/pensieve#)! I
intend to use this space to experiment with the latest in open source tools for
building apps and websites, as well as to dump my thoughts and ramblings.

これからよろしくお願いしますね。

While building this website, I got a little intimate with:

*   Ruby
    *   Gems, Bundler, etc
*   YAML
*   Jekyll
    *   Liquid template
    *   Theme and plugin gems

And while setting up my dev environment:

*   Docker
    *   My [`Dockerfile`](https://gist.github.com/santoso-wijaya/bfd10ec29deb3a7fd2e69c854af72bfb)
*   [devcontainer](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/adding-a-dev-container-configuration/introduction-to-dev-containers)

And while deploying it:

*   [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com)

I gotta say, Jekyll is very powerful for a static site generator. And it's quite
pleasant to use, too!

I kinda want to get deeper into its plugin than theming systems and/or get my
hands cut on some Ruby.

👆🏼 Neovide with notable settings and plugins:

* [NERDTree](https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree)
* gutters shown
* [vim-airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline), with
  * [devicons](https://devicon.dev)
  * Monaspace Neon [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) for
    glyphs
* Solarized color scheme

I'd been zipping around NeoVim, in both terminal and NeoVide, especially with
a newfound power in `mini.jump2d` and `vim-easymotion` (I would eventually
replace these two with [`hop.nvim`](https://github.com/hadronized/hop.nvim)).

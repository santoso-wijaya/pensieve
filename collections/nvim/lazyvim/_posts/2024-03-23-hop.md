I liked `vim-easymotion` in plain Vim. `hop.nvim` is the NeoVim equivalent.
I had to script the keybindings (with `which-keys` so that they can be
displayed as keybinding hints in the UI, too). They look nice, and
hint-hopping is such a powerful way to move around in Vim.

(In Solarized dark this time)

I installed `hop.nvim` and registers its keybindings with `which-key`. In
[`~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/hop.lua`](https://github.com/santoso-wijaya/lazyvim-config/blob/3d9393adacaa03bdb5a44e6a3c920096cefb3cfe/lua/plugins/hop.lua):

```lua
-- `hop` is an EasyMotion-like plugin allowing you to jump anywhere in a
-- document with as few keystrokes as possible.
return {
  "smoka7/hop.nvim",
  version = "*",
  main = "hop",
  opts = {
    keys = "hklyuiopnm,qwertzxcvbasdgjf;",
  },
  config = function(plugin, opts)
    local hop = require(plugin.main)
    hop.setup(opts)

    -- Hop doesn't set any keybindings; we will have to define them ourselves.
    -- Let's map some keys to Hop commands.
    -- Command list: https://github.com/smoka7/hop.nvim/wiki/Commands
    --
    -- Register keybindings with `which-key` so that they also get helpful
    -- documentation when <leader> is pressed, in a window dressing.
    local wk = require("which-key")
    wk.register({
      h = {
        name = "hop", -- the group name; shows up in which-key window
        -- <leader>hw => hints for all words in the buffer; most useful hop command!
        w = { "<cmd>HopWord<cr>", "Hop to all words in the visible buffer; most useful!" },
        -- <leader>hl => hints for hopping to the beginning of any visible line
        l = { "<cmd>HopLine<cr>", "Hop to the first column of each visible line" },
        s = { "<cmd>HopLineStart<cr>", "Hop to the first non-whitespace character of each line" },
        v = { "<cmd>HopVertical<cr>", "Hop to each line, keeping cursor column position the same" },
        -- <leader>h/ => enter search pattern => hints for hopping
        ["/"] = { "<cmd>HopPattern<cr>", "Validate search (`/`) with hints" },
        -- <leader>ha => hop anywhere
        a = { "<cmd>HopAnywhere<cr>", "Hop anywhere" },
      },
    }, { prefix = "<leader>" })
  end,
}
```

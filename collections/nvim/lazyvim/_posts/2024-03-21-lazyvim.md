## LazyVim ðŸ’¤

LazyVim is a NeoVim plugin manager. It comes with a bundle of plugins that the
author/community has vetted to be working quite well together.

It makes managing nvim plugins and configuring them to your tastes quite easy
and pleasant to do. I've been having a blast with it.

## Solarized â˜¯

The first thing that I did was to install and configure Solarized colorscheme.

In LazyVim, I simply created a
[`solarized.lua`](https://github.com/santoso-wijaya/lazyvim-config/blob/3d9393adacaa03bdb5a44e6a3c920096cefb3cfe/lua/plugins/solarized.lua)
file in `~/.config/nvim/lua/plugins` directory.

```lua
return {
  -- add Lua-scriptable solarized color scheme
  {
    "maxmx03/solarized.nvim",
    lazy = false,
    name = "solarized",
    main = "solarized",
    priority = 1000,
    -- See: https://www.lazyvim.org/configuration/plugins#%EF%B8%8F-customizing-plugin-specs
    opts = {
      -- See: https://github.com/maxmx03/solarized.nvim?tab=readme-ov-file#default-config
      styles = {
        -- Turn off the bolding of keywords syntax that this particular scheme does
        keywords = { bold = false },
      },
    },
    config = function(plugin, opts)
      vim.o.background = "light"
      require(plugin.main).setup(opts)
      vim.cmd.colorscheme = "solarized"
    end,
  },

  -- configure LazyVim to load solarized
  {
    "LazyVim/LazyVim",
    opts = {
      colorscheme = "solarized",
    },
  },
}
```

I quite enjoyed how much more structured that process was, especially NeoVim's
scriptability with Lua.

In NeoVide, this looks ðŸ”¥
